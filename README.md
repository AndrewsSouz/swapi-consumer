### swapi-consumer
#### A rest java api that consumes the public star wars api to improve knowledge of Star Wars obviously.

This code is a personal project to improve my java code skills, not a simple java code, it comes with Gradle, Spring and Lombok 
to let the work simple and easy.

My next TODOS:

==> Make it a Gradle Multiproject and implent another micro-service to take the data retrieved from the api and persist
in a local MongoDB.

==> Store the application and db in Docker containers to up it with docker compose.

I gona think in more itens.
